# CS-370
Current/Emerging Trends in CS

For this project, the goal was for the agent to learn the most efficient way through a maze. I developed code for the Q-Training implementation designated by the #TODO, and was given all other code. <be>

*Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:* <br>
- *What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?*<br>
Computer scientists solve problems. Through hardware and software, we improve our daily lives and businesses. Technologies like the ones we studied in this course are among many that improve efficiency and quality of life and push the boundaries of what is possible.<br>

- *How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?*<br>
When approaching a problem it is important to first ensure you understand the problem. You must break it down into more manageable parts or sub-problems wherever possible. From there you can design a solution and ensure you have the resources you need to develop that solution.<br>

- *What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?*<br>
It is my responsibility to protect the privacy of the end-user and the organization. Moreover, one must act with transparency, provide accurate information, and ensure the final product does not harm the end-user or the organization. It is also important to abide by any applicable laws or regulations for the safety of both parties.
